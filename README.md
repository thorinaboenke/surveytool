Deciding on the core features, considering what is feasible in the given timeframe of 72h (minus other weekend activities, corona test and another job interview... )

- User signup/login
- Creating surveys with a title and an arbitrary amount of questions/rating categories
- Delete option for surveys and single questions
- Dashboard with all created surveys of a user
- Overview page for each survey with the number of participants and average scores
- dynamic url for filling out the survey (anonymously)
- rating options 1-5 for each question/category
- progress tracker, thank you message
- (nice to have) possibility for free text feedback, display when the survey was created
